    "main 1": "We are a group of passionate students from PushQuantum e.V., a student initiative based in Munich. Our team is made up of a diverse group of physics and engineering students from the Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians University, united by a shared enthusiasm for quantum science and technology.",
    "main 2": "This project originated from the Quantenträume and Sustainability Department of PushQuantum. \"Quanten(t)räume\" is an outreach initiative funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, in collaboration with Deutsches Museum, Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik (MPQ), PhotonLab, Fraunhofer Institut für System- und Innovationsforschung (ISI), TECHNOMUSEUM, Munich Center for Quantum Science & Technology (MCQST), IQM and Munich Quantum Valley (MQV).",
    "main 3": "Together, we are dedicated to enlightening the general public about the potential applications of quantum technologies and fostering a dialogue between researchers and the public. Our commitment lies in making quantum technology accessible and engaging, not solely for the purpose of attracting talent but to ensure that quantum technology evolves in alignment with the public's perception and wishes. Only when quantum technology is demystified can we genuinely earn the public's trust.",
    "main 4": "Driven by this vision, we have sought new ways to engage with the community and capture the progress that has been made. To that end, we present our digital twin of the \"Quanten(t)räume\" grant: the WiQi. Through this platform we seek to provide an engaging space for everyone to learn about quantum technology, regardless of their prior knowledge.",
    "main 5": "We firmly believe that quantum science and technology have the potential to revolutionize our future. As the generation poised to lead this transformation, we are committed to equipping society with the knowledge and tools to prepare for, and actively participate in this ground-breaking movement.",

Whether it's helping students survive their computer science exams, building learning platforms that (hopefully) make studying less painful, or now trying to figure out how many qubits it takes before things get weird. And sometimes I end up automating 5-minute tasks into 5-hour coding sessions",

I believe the Star Wars Prequels are cinema, not just memes - but will quote them like scripture anyways! Once I tried explaining entanglement using midichlorian, it may or may not have worked.

Apart from my interesting music taste, and funny but yet succesful approaches to explain quantum physics, I spend quite some time researching funny cat videos to brighten other people's days. Also here's a fun fact: Sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphins. I think maybe they forgot how to breathe (lol).",
