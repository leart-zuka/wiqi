# What is cryptography?
Cryptography describes the science of encrypting and transmitting information in such a way that only authorized people can decrypt it.

We distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
In symmetric cryptography, Alice and Bob share a secret key.
However, since it is difficult to transmit this key securely in practice, asymmetric cryptography is often used.
To do this, Bob publishes a public key that Alice uses to encrypt the message.
Only Bob, who has the private key, can decrypt the message.
In the next section, we will look at the RSA algorithm, a widely used asymmetric cryptosystem.

# The RSA Algorithm

The RSA algorithm is based on the mathematical difficulty of breaking large numbers down into their prime factors.
To understand how it works, let's look at a simple example:

1. Bob randomly selects two prime numbers, e.g., $p=5$ and $q=11$. We call the product $n = p \times q = 55$.
2. Next, he calculates the least common multiple of $(p-1)$ and $(q-1)$, i.e., $\text{lcm}(4, 10) = 20$. We call this number $k$, and it must remain secret, just like $p$ and $q$.
3. Bob chooses a number $1 < e < k$ that is coprime to $k$, e.g., $e=3$.
4. Now Bob calculates the number $d$, which is the multiplicative inverse of [$e$ modulo $k$](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/modulo-calculator.php). In our case, $d=7$, since $(e \times d) \mod k = 21 \mod 20 = 1$.
5. Now Bob can publish the public key $(e, n) = (3, 55)$.

If Alice wants to send Bob a message $m=42$, she can encrypt it using Bob's public key:
$$
c = m^e\mod n = 42^3\mod 55 = 3
$$
She sends the encrypted message $c=3$ to Bob, who can then easily decrypt it with his secret key:
$$
m = c^d \mod n = 3^7 \mod 55 = 42
$$
# Security through difficulty
If you go back and look at Bob's steps, you will see that each individual step (perhaps with a calculator) is very simple.
So where does the security lie?
The security lies in the fact that Eve can only extract $n$ from the public key. She would have to calculate $p, q$ and thus $k$ herself.
Now, of course, one might think that it is not so difficult to factorize $n=55$.
But $55$ was only an example, a number that can be represented in a computer with 6 bits as $55_{10} = 110111_2$.
In practice, however, numbers with a length of 2048, 3072, or even 4096 bits are used.
A 2048-bit number looks something like this:
$$

$$
Factoring this number is considered so difficult that a prize of US$200,000 has been offered for the correct solution.
# The classic algorithm
Just by looking at the number, it becomes clear that humans have no chance of factoring it.
But what about computers?
Perhaps the new supercomputer in Jülich can do it?
In fact, even this is overwhelmed by the task.
To get an idea of why it is so difficult, let's look at a slightly simpler algorithm: trial division.
![Execution of the Trial Division algorithm for prime factorization of 175.](/posts/assets/quantum_cryptography/trial_division.png)
For a number $n = 175$, we calculate all prime numbers up to $\sqrt{n} \approx 13.23$, i.e. $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$.
Then we try: we divide $175$ by each of these prime numbers and see if we get an integer result.
If so, then we have found a prime factor and divide the result again by all prime numbers until the result is a prime number again.
Since an $n$ bit number can be up to $2^n$ in size, and every number $m$ has approximately $\frac{m}{\ln(m)}$ prime numbers less than or equal to $m$ (see [Prime Number Theorem](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primzahlsatz)), in the worst case, we have to try up to $\frac{2^{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{n}$ prime numbers.
In computer science, this is referred to as exponential in $n$ – in other words, extremely inefficient.

# Residue Class Group

To understand why a quantum computer can crack the RSA algorithm, we first need to look at the mathematical object known as the residue class group.
This residue class group can be thought of as something like a clock:

![Visualization of the residue class group modulo 15 (for addition)](/posts/assets/quantum_cryptography/rest_group.png)

You can calculate with the numbers as normal, but when you go beyond 15, you start again at 0, or more specifically, you calculate the remainder when dividing by 15.
If you calculate $1+4$, the result is $5$, as expected.
It only gets interesting when you go beyond $15$.
For example, $13 + 4 = 17$, but in the residue class group modulo $15$, $17 \mod 15 = 2$.
The situation is similar with multiplication.
Due to the mathematical [definition of a group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), the residue class group modulo 15 looks slightly different for multiplication:
![Visualization of the residue class group mudolo 15 (for multiplication)](/posts/assets/quantum_cryptography/mult_group.png)
This is because every element must have an inverse, meaning there must always be a number $b$ such that $a \times b \mod 15 = 1$.
For example, $3$ is not an element of the group because there is no number $b$ such that $3 \times b \mod 15 = 1$.

# Periodicity

But why do we need the residue class group in the first place?
Well, because we have this clock-like structure, we can take advantage of an interesting property of numbers in such a group: periodicity.
This means that if we multiply a number $a$ in the residue class group modulo $n$ by itself over and over again, we will eventually get $1$ again.
The smallest $r$ such that $a^r \mod n = 1$ is called the period of $a$ in the residue class group modulo $n$.
![Visualization of the periodicity of 2 and 4 in the residue class group modulo 15.](/posts/assets/quantum_cryptography/periodicity.png)
In the figure, we see that, for example, the period of $2$ in our example is equal to $4$, since $2^4 \mod 15 = 16 \mod 15 = 1$.
And now comes the trick, because with a little luck, $\text{gcm}(a^{\frac{r}{2}}-1, n)$ is a non-trivial factor (i.e., not $1$ or $n$) of $n$.
Mathematically, this can be justified with [Euler's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem), but that would be going too far at this point.
Back to our example: If we choose $a=4$ and $r=2$, then
$$
\text{gcm}(4^{\frac{2}{2}}-1, 15) = \text{gcm}(3, 15) = 3
$$
And indeed, $3$ is a prime factor of $15$!

# Superposition

Now we just need to find a way to efficiently calculate the period $r$.
To do this, we use quantum mechanics and the concept of superposition.
In quantum mechanics, qubits ([Learn more here](https://wiqi.info/en/posts/quantum_tuesdays/elementary/Bits%20To%20Qubits)) can assume not only the states $0$ and $1$, but also superpositions of these states.
So instead of knowing in advance whether a qubit is $0$ or $1$, it can be in a state that is both at the same time.
We write this as:
$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers whose magnitudes indicate the probabilities with which the qubit will be measured in one state or the other.
When we measure, something interesting happens: The qubit “collapses” into one of the two states, either $0$ or $1$, with probabilities $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$.
And that's what a quantum computer takes advantage of:
![Visualization of period determination using a quantum computer.](/posts/assets/quantum_cryptography/qpe_en.png)
It starts in the first register with a superposition of all possible states.
In this example, we have 3 qubits, so $2^3 = 8$ possible states.
Now let's try again to determine the period of $4$ in the residue class group modulo $15$.
Then we calculate $4^x \mod 15$ in the second register for each $x$ in the first register.
When we measure the second register, it collapses to one of the values, either $1$ or $4$.
Let's just assume it collapses to $1$ (it makes no difference).
This also causes the first register to collapse and only the values $x$ for which $4^x \mod 15 = 1$ remain.
In our case, these are $x=0, 2, 4, 6$.
We can already see that the period is $r=2$, since the values in the first register all differ by $2$.
Although the quantum computer cannot “see” this, it can now also efficiently determine the period using a so-called [quantum Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform).

# Why haven't I been hacked yet?

Anyone asking themselves this question can rest assured.
The largest number that has been factored in this way so far is $15$, which is just what we have already done several times here today.
