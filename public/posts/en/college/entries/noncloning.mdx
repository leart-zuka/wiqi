# Introduction

In quantum physics we have the non-cloning theorem, which states that it is not possible to have an operation that can copy a quantum state.
The fastest way to explain this is to use a simple equation.
Given two quantum systems $\ket{\psi}_A$ and $\ket{\psi}_B$, the non-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create a unitary operator $U$ that copies the system $\ket{\psi}_A$ to $\ket{\psi}_B$ to get $\ket{\psi}_B$.
To see why, we can first assume that such an operator $U$ exists.
This is a common method of proof in mathematics.

# Proof

First we assume that something is possible, but then we show that this leads to a contradiction.
The complete quantum system can be described by the tensor product of the two systems $A$ and $B$:
\[ \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi} \]
Now let's apply the $U$ operator to the system A.
\[U(\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}) = \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi}\]
We can do this a second time with a different state $\ket{e}$:
\[U(\ket{e} \otimes \ket{\phi}) = \ket{e} \otimes \ket{e}\]
Since $U$ is a unitary operator, it has the property that it preserves the inner product of these two states.
If we take the inner product before cloning, we can compute:
\[(\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}) \cdot \ket{e} \otimes \ket{\phi} = \braket{\psi | e}\braket{\phi | \phi}\]
This is great, now let us do the same thing after using the cloning operator $U$:

\[(\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi}) \cdot (\ket{e} \otimes \ket{e}) = \braket{\psi | e} \braket{\psi | e} = \braket{\psi | e}^2\]
Now, if we combine our two equations, we get:
\[\braket{\psi | e} = \braket{\psi | e}^2\]

This equation has only two solutions, 0 or 1. If we have $\braket{\psi}{e} = 0$, then the two quantum states are completely orthogonal to each other. In other words, the states cannot be further apart.
If we get 1, it means that the quantum state must be the same.
What is the problem with this?
Well, the problem is a bit hidden, because this means that the states cannot be arbitrary.
If we set $\ket{\psi}$ to any state we want, then we have to set $\ket{e}$ either to the same state or to an orthogonal state.
So the theory that we cannot copy an arbitrary quantum state is true.
