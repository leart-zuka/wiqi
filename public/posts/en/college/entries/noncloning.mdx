## Introduction

In quantum physics, we have the **No-Cloning Theorem**, which states that it is not possible to have an operation that can perfectly copy an arbitrary pure quantum state while leaving the original state intact.

Let's say we have a system **A**, which is in the unknown state $$ \ket{\psi} $$ that we want to copy. We also have a system **B**, which is our blank page in a known state $$ \ket{\phi} $$.
We use the Tensor Product ($$ \otimes $$) to combine both states A and B. A perfect cloning machine would be a unitary operator, $$ U $$, that could take this combined state and evolve it like this:

$$
U (\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}) \to \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi}
$$

To see why this is impossible, we can first assume that such an operator $$ U $$ does exist. This is a common method of proof in mathematics: proof by contradiction.

## Proof

First, we assume our cloning machine $$ U $$ works for any state.
Let's see what happens when we feed it $$ \ket{\psi} $$:

$$
U(\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}) = \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi}
$$

Since the machine must work for any state, let's test it a second time with a different state $$ \ket{e} $$ while keeping the blank state $$ \ket{\phi} $$ the same:

$$
U(\ket{e} \otimes \ket{\phi}) = \ket{e} \otimes \ket{e}
$$

So far, so good. Now, here's the key: $$ U $$ is a unitary operator (it represents a valid quantum evolution). A fundamental property of all unitary operators is that they preserve the inner product.
This means the inner product $$ \langle \cdot | \cdot \rangle $$ of our two starting states (before cloning) must be equal to the inner product of our two final states (after cloning). Let's take the inner product of our two initial states:

$$
\langle \text{start}_1 | \text{start}_2 \rangle = (\bra{\psi} \otimes \bra{\phi}) \cdot (\ket{e} \otimes \ket{\phi})
$$

Using the rules of tensor products, this reduces to:

$$
= \braket{\psi | e} \braket{\phi | \phi}
$$

Since $$ \ket{\phi} $$ is our blank state, it's a normalized quantum state, which means $$ \braket{\phi | \phi} = 1 $$. So, our "before" inner product is simply:

$$
\langle \text{start}_1 | \text{start}_2 \rangle = \braket{\psi | e}
$$

Now, let's do the same thing for our two *final* states:

$$
\langle \text{final}_1 | \text{final}_2 \rangle = (\bra{\psi} \otimes \bra{\psi}) \cdot (\ket{e} \otimes \ket{e})
$$

This also separates:

$$
= \braket{\psi | e} \braket{\psi | e} = (\braket{\psi | e})^2
$$

Because $$ U $$ is unitary, the "before" and "after" inner products must be equal.
So, we have:

$$
\braket{\psi | e} = (\braket{\psi | e})^2
$$

This equation has only two solutions, 0 or 1. 
That is, our cloning machine only works if the states we feed it are either:
1.  Completely orthogonal ($$ \braket{\psi | e} = 0 $$).
2.  Exactly the same ($$ \braket{\psi | e} = 1 $$).

This is the contradiction! Because this means that the states cannot be arbitrary. What if $$ \ket{\psi} = \ket{0} $$ and $$ \ket{e} = \ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1}) $$?
Their inner product is $$ \braket{\psi | e} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} $$.
Our equation would be $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2 = \frac{1}{2} $$, which is false.
If we set $$ \ket{\psi} $$ to any state we want, then we have to set $$ \ket{e} $$ either to the same state or to an orthogonal state.
This means our assumption that such a universal cloning machine $$ U $$ exists must be wrong.
So the theory that we cannot copy an arbitrary quantum state is true.

## Conclusion

This forces us to design entirely new types of algorithms that don't need to copy information. But this theorem can also be an advantage! 
It guarantees that an anyone can't just listen in on a quantum channel and secretly copy the message. The moment they try to "look" ([_measure_](/en/posts/entries/college/measurement)), they will inevitably disturb the original, and the sender and receiver will know immediately that someone is listening.
