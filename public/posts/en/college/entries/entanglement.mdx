##Entanglement

Two particles are said to be entangled if they cannot be described independently. Their quantum states are not independent but directly correlated. Their measurements therefore cannot be described separately, as they are intrinsically linked to the state of each other.
To visualize this, consider the following analogy of two coins. Coins can be in exactly two states: heads or tails. Similarly to particles, which can be in spin up or spin down, or as qubits in their O or 1 state. Measuring the coins (or particles) will have to yield one of the two states.
Thereby, when flipping two coins there a four possible outcomes, shown in the graphic below:

Let's assume that two coins are entangled and then separated. Person 1 receives coin A, Person 2 receives coin B. The two individuals go into separate rooms. On the count of three, both of them flip their coins and keep the results hidden. Person 1 then lifts their hand and sees that coin A shows "Head" (H). Without Person 2 revealing coin B yet, we can already predict with certainty that coin B will show "Tails"(T). Upon revealing coin B, this predictions proves to be correct.
Normally, flipping two coins gives four possible combinations: \text{HH, HT, TH, TT}.
In quantum mechanics, this relationship can be expressed mathematically using a quantum state called a Bell state, which represents a maximally entangled system. One such Bell state is:

\ket{\Psi^-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}\big),

where \ket{\uparrow\downarrow} means particle A is spin up, and particle B is spin down, and \ket{\downarrow\uparrow} means the opposite.

## The EPR thought experiment

In 1935, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen proposed what is now known as the "EPR thought experiment". The goal of this experiment was to demonstrate that quantum mechanics is "incomplete", as it would not account for every element of reality.
The experiment considers two particles, generated from a single source in such a way that their quantum states become correlated. These particles are then separated by any distance. Particles are in a constant spin, which can either be a spin "down" or a spin "up". Denoting the two particles as A and B, if one measures A and yields spin up as a result, B will with 100% certainty be in a spin down position, and vice versa.
According to quantum mechanics, before you measure the spin of either particle, they exist in a superposition, described as: 

\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} + \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}\big).

Yielding a measurement after the collapse of one particle of such a pair allows us to instantaneously know the measurement of the second particle. The crucial point here is that this relationship holds even when the particles are far apart. This suggests, that it is thereby possible to predict the measurement of the second particle without directly interfering or disturbing its state.
However, this led to a paradox (EPR paradox or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox).
When measuring the two particles simultaneously, information appears to travel faster than light from the Location of particle A to particle B, in order to influence B's measurement post measurement of A. This would violate the principle of relativity, which prohibits faster-than-light communication. Einstein referred to this phenomena as "spooky action from a distance".
EPR led to the conclusion that there exists some local hidden variable or "element of reality", well defined before any measurement. According to Einstein, “the situation of system B is independent of what is done with system A, which is spatially separated from the former”.
We now know that this is a “misunderstanding” of a quantum mechanical property, because no information is transmitted during this quantum process. Classical communication would be required to perform any useful information exchange, following general relativity. This quantum property was later formalised as "entanglement" by Erwin Schrödinger.

## Bell's inequality

In 1964, John Bell proved a groundbreaking mathematical theorem that demonstrated the incompatibility of local hidden variable theories with quantum mechanics. He did this by proposing a Gedankenexperiment in which those theories would have different predictions.
The Bell’s inequality, related to the expected value of a quantity measured in an experiment, must be satisfied by any local hidden variable theory.

|E(a, b) - E(a, c)| \leq 1 + E(b, c),

where E is the average value obtained over all a particular set of experiments.
Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) derived a modified version of Bell’s inequality called CHSH. Since Bell’s pioneering work, numerous experiments have been conducted to test the CHSH inequality. While early experiments suffered from various loopholes, more recent experiments have closed these loopholes and convincingly demonstrated the violation of the CHSH inequality, ruling out local hidden variable theories.
