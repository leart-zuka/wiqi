## NISQ

Developing a new technology takes time. In the case of quantum technology, understanding how to best create it is very closely linked to understanding quantum science better too. This lends itself well to building up our knowledge iteratively, as quantum technology will be extremely good at shedding light on quantum science!
For example, some quantum computers use superconducting qubits as their hardware basis. In order to keep them superconducting, they need to be cooled within a big fridge called a cryostat. At the moment, this is limiting the size of the quantum computer to how much we can fit inside the cryostat. The more wires we add, the more it heats up.
But quantum computers hold the potential to better modelling the quantum behaviour that creates superconductivitity and hence could help us understand how to make room temperature and pressure superconductors. Then we wouldn't need the cryostat at all!

The end goal for is to build a so-called “fault-tolerant quantum computer”. All computers make errors while processing, but whether these errors can be adequately corrected is the hallmark of an accurate, dependable computer.

Before we are able to reach this, we will need to practice building lots of smaller quantum computers. These will still be imperfect. They will be influenced by "noise" that affects or destroys the quantum states inside. Researchers are developing methods to keep qubits both isolated from noise (such as vibrations and light), while also being able to access them to interact purposefully so that calculations can be carried out.
Noise will accumulate during an experiment, meaning only calculations within a short enough timeframe will be possible.
This era of quantum computers is what we are currently in. It is referred to as the "NISQ era", which stands for "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum".
The only accesible algorithms will have a smaller number of qubits and a shorter length of runtime than what scientists predict will realise the full potential of quantum computing. Currently we have hundreds of qubits per quantum computer at best. To fulfill many potential applications, more like millions are needed.
This is very comparable to classical computers: the computer that helped put man on the moon for the first time had only thousands of transistors whereas laptops now have tens of billions!

Lots of work is currently underway to discover how to still do useful calculations with NISQ computers. It is a case of hardware and software meeting in the middle. As the hardware scales up, clever tricks in software help get the most of each experiment.
