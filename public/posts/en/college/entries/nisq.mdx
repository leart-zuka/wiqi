## Quantum Tech, One Step at a Time

Developing a new technology takes time. In the case of quantum technology, understanding how to best create it is very closely linked to understanding quantum science better too. This lends itself well to building up our knowledge iteratively, as quantum technology will be extremely good at shedding light on quantum science!
For example, some quantum computers use superconducting qubits as their hardware basis. In order to keep them superconducting, they need to be cooled within a big fridge called a cryostat. At the moment, this is limiting the size of the quantum computer to how much we can fit inside the cryostat. The more wires we add, the more it heats up.
But quantum computers hold the potential to better modelling the quantum behaviour that creates superconductivitity and hence could help us understand how to make room temperature and pressure superconductors. Then we wouldn't need the cryostat at all!

## NISQ era

The end goal is to build a so-called “fault-tolerant quantum computer”. All computers make errors while processing, but whether these errors can be adequately corrected is the hallmark of an accurate, dependable computer.

Before we are able to reach this, we will need to practice and get better at building lots of smaller quantum computers. These small computers are poweful, but still imperfect; they are influenced by "noise" that affect or destroy the quantum states inside. Researchers are developing methods to keep qubits both isolated from noise (such as mechanical vibrations and light), while also being able to access them to interact purposefully so that calculations can be carried out.
Noise during an experiment will accumulate over time, meaning only calculations within a short enough timeframe will be possible.

This era of quantum computers is what we are currently in. It is referred to as the "NISQ era", which stands for "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum". “Intermediate Scale” means that we have more qubits than can be simulated by classical computers, but not enough to implement quantum error correction, which is needed for fault-tolerance. Without the safety of error correction, running algorithms on the system is extremely limited.
Ergo, we can only use quantum algorithms that utilize a much smaller number of qubits and a shorter lengths of runtime than what scientists predict will realise the full potential of quantum computing. Currently we have hundreds of qubits per quantum computer at best. To fulfill many potential applications, we'd need like millions at least.
This is very comparable to classical computers: the computer that helped put man on the moon for the first time had only thousands of transistors whereas laptops now have tens of billions!

## What can we do with NISQ?

So what can we do with these noisy machines? Luckily, they are perfectly suited for certain types of problems where getting a perfect, exact answer isn't necessary. These are often problems in optimization, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. Using algorithms like VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) or QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), a NISQ computer can explore complex possibilities to find very good, approximate solutions, even if noise prevents it from being perfect every time.
The question still remains, whether these devices can perform a task that surpasses the capabilities of any classical computer, a milestone called "quantum advantage". This is a surprisingly high bar to clear. Lots of work is currently underway to discover how to still do useful calculations with NISQ computers. It is a case of hardware and software meeting in the middle. As the hardware scales up, clever tricks in software help get the most of each experiment.
