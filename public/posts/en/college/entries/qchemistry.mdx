## Quantum Simulation - Chemistry

Drug discovery nowadays is a resource-intensive process and requires a substantial investment of time and money. With recent events, such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and the constantly rising expenses of introducing a new drug, the demand for advancements in drug design and development continues to increase.
Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has emerged as a transformative field with the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, as it addresses the above mentioned challenges. Traditionally, it could take 10–15 years for a new drug to reach the market. This process can be significantly
accelerated by the combination of CADD with technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). With CADD, the in silico testing process is expedited, allowing
researchers to predict drug-target interactions, assess toxicity, and optimize compound design in
a virtual environment. As a result, in silico testing has become a powerful tool for early-stage
drug discovery. Furthermore, it substantially reduces the reliance on traditional, time-consuming
animal testing and, thereby, also contributes to ethical principles. The same advantage can also be seen by applying computational methods to material science. However, despite the ongoing developments of this field, traditional computers are still limited due to the nature of a molecule.
The behavior of a molecule is dependent on their electrons, which are of quantum nature and reigned by the rules of quantum mechanics. This involves phenomenas, such as superposition and entanglement. These quantum properties make it hard for classical, binary computers to simulate molecules, as extensive calculations are required.
Classical computers must represent the entire quantum wavefunction and track all possible combination of states.

As these are both resource and time-intensive tasks, they are done through approximations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Hartree-Fock.

However, approximations always lack in accuracy to a certain degree, and perhaps the biggest challenge is the exponential complexity of a quantum system. These calculations can be done for only a very small number of atoms, before the exponential scaling, increases the required computational resources to an infeasible degree.

This is where quantum computers offer a quantum advantage. Classical computers struggle, since electrons don't exist in only one state at the same time, because they are inherently quantum, and thereby not natively representable in binary logic. However, a qubit behaves according to quantum mechanics and thereby displayes the same phenomenas. Since qubits can be in a superposition state, they can simply store the state of an electron. Similarly, qubits can be entagled with each other and accurately mimick the entaglement of electrons in a molecule.
For example, a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21812485/) showed, that simulating 8 caffeine molecules in water took 50 days on a 8-core Linux cluster. And this is still a very moderate system - far from the molecular complexity that real breakthroughs in drug discovery or materials science demand. For reference, compare the size of a caffeine molecule (top) to the cytostatic (medication used to treat cancer) compound Paclitaxel (bottom):

Simulating even larger molecules, such as complex biomolecules or metal-organic frameworks is beyond the classical methods.
Quantum computers have the capability to overcome all of these challenges, enabling the accurate simulation of quantum systems which are currently intractable. For example, recent developments in quantum algorithms highlighted a quantum computers strength regarding solving the quantum many-body problem, which occurs in a variety of areas within quantum chemistry. For instance, in electronic structure theory algorithms such as the Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm (QPEA) exist to determine ground state energies of molecular systems.

At the core of all quantum simulations lies the Hamiltonian, which describes the total energy of the system. In quantum chemistry, the electronic structure problem is generally encoded in the second-quantized Hamiltonian:

$$
H = \sum_{pq} h_{pq} a_p^\dagger a_q + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs} a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_r a_s
$$

Here, $ a*p^\dagger $ and $ a_q $ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, and the coefficients $ h*{pq} $ and $ h\_{pqrs} $ correspond to one- and two-electron integrals that depend on the molecular orbitals. This Hamiltonian encodes all the interactions within the molecule and is the object that quantum algorithms like QPEA or the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) attempt to solve.
In the case of VQE, the algorithm prepares a trial quantum state $ \psi(\theta) $ and evaluates the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:

$$
E(\theta) = \langle\psi(\theta)| H |\psi(\theta)\rangle
$$

This value is minimized over the parameters $ \theta $ using a classical optimizer to approximate the ground state energy.

The typical workflow of such algorithms starts by mapping the Hamiltonian to qubit states and operations through the encoding of the fermionic states and operators. Fermions are a group of subatomic particles, which includes e.g. electrons or protons. They are a fundamental particles with a half-integer spin (1/2), that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states, that in a quantum system that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics, such as an atom, two particles with half-integer spins, such as fermions, can't simultaneously occupy the same quantum state. In an atom, no two electrons (that occupy the same orbital) can have the same quantum number. This means, that only one of the electrons can have a spin up (+ 1/2), and the other one has to have a spin down (-1/2).
The fermionic creation and annihilation operators can be mapped through a variety ways, such as through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. This transformation enables fermionic systems to be represented on quantum hardware. Each fermionic mode corresponds to a qubit in the $ s_z $ eigenbasis, and occupation is encoded directly in qubit states. The mapping preserves the fermionic anti-commutation relations by translating operators into non-local strings of Pauli matrices:

$$
a_j = \frac{1}{2} (X_j + i Y_j) \bigotimes_{k=0}^{j-1} Z_k, \quad
a_j^\dagger = \frac{1}{2} (X_j - i Y_j) \bigotimes_{k=0}^{j-1} Z_k.
$$

This representation is exact in one dimension and commonly used for simulating fermionic systems like molecules or lattice models. Here, $X_j$, $Y_j$, and $Z_k$ are Pauli matrices acting on qubit $j$ or $k$, and the tensor product $\bigotimes$ ensures correct ordering and anticommutation properties required for fermions. Other mapping techniques include the parity mapping and the Bravyi-Kitaev scheme. Once the mapping is suitable, an algorithm, such as the ones mentioned, prepare the quantum state or electronic density of the molecule of interest and compute the averages from the qubits of the quantum circuits in order to retrieve simulation parameters.

Quantum simulations hold the potential to revolutionise the modeling of molecules and their interactions for both drug discovery, as well as material science. These are two of the most promising applications of quantum computing in the near future.
