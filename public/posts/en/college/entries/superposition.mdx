# Intro

Today we want to understand the differences between a bit, that's being used in our day to day electronics and everything where data is being handled, and a qubit, which forms the basis of a quantum computer.

But first we have to look at a standard bit is before we move forward to its quantum sibling.

Afterwards we're going to take a look at how we can transform these two newly learned concepts and how qubits behave much more differently thanks to their quantum properties.

## Bit

A bit is the most basic unit of information when it comes data that is being handled, e.g. by computers.
It stores one value that can be represented as either a "1" or "0" (or "on" or "off"), similar to how a light switch can either be in an "on" or "off" position.

## Qubit

A qubit is unfortunately not as simple as a regular bit and involves a bit of math to properly define it.

In essence a qubit can be understood as the superposition of two basis states. So it's as if we were to overlap the two outcomes of our bit (so "1" and "0").

Mathematically one would write this superposition state as:

$$ \ket{\Psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} $$

However after measuring our qubit (i.e. by looking at our fancy measurement devices), the qubit will ultimately end up being a "1" or "0" or commonly represented as `|1>` or `|0>`, where the probabilities of landing in either state are expressed via the two prefactors whose squares must be equal to 1:

$$ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

But the interesting features lie in the fact that the qubit randomly decides which value, so either "1" or "0" or commonly represented as `|1>` or `|0>` when talking about qubits, it wants to hold when performing the actual measurement.

One way of visualizing how this "random picking" might work is with a so called `Bloch Sphere`, where the chances of picking `|1>` or `|0>` are represented by an arrow pointing from the center of the surface to the sphere.

### Visualization of a qubit state

A so called qubit state, so basically the chances of the qubit either being a `|1>` or `|0>`, can be described by a so called `Bloch Sphere`, named after the physicist Felix Bloch.

The main ideas are:

- The further the arrow points up or down, the higher the chance that when measuring the state of the qubit, it will either show `|0>` or `|1>`. This also means that if the arrow points along the equator, the chances of getting either `|0>` or `|1>` are 50/50.

- After the measurement, depending on the outcome, the qubit will always point either fully up or fully down, as that's when it `collapses` to its definite value.

- Its rotation, so whether it points along the x- or y-axis also plays a role, but is beyond the scope of this post.

This all seems very interesting, but now we also need to understand how to manipulate these qu-/bits in order to make them useful for our, hopefully good-natured, purposes.

# Logical Gates

Logical gates are components of electrical or quantum circuits that allow us to tansform and manipulate the data that is being stored in bits and qubits.

## Bits

Bits as stated before either have a value of "1" or "0", and logical gates allow us to to change these values itself or use them to change values of other bits.

Two important gates, among the many others, are the so called `NOT` and `AND` gate.

### NOT - Gate

A `NOT` gate behaves ins a rather simple fassion, by taking our input and negating it, thus turning a "1" into a "0" and vice verca.
