## Introduction

Cloning? That sounds like science fiction, doesn’t it?
In the quantum world, "cloning" is just a fancy word for "copying."
And the **Non-Cloning Theorem** or **No-Cloning Theorem** is a very important and kind of a strange rule. It says that you can never make a perfect copy of a quantum state.

Imagine a life without a printer or without copying files on your smartphone. That would be really inconvenient, right? 
Now what does that mean in the quantum world? Imagine a spinning coin, which almost behaves like a system that's in  ([_quantum superposition_](/en/posts/entries/elementary/superposition)). In order to make a perfect copy of that spinning coin, you need to know it's spinning in that exact moment where you're trying to copy it. 

But if you touch to look at it, you will disturb it and it will stop spinning! So you can never know exactly how it was spinning, and therefore you can never make a perfect copy of it.
That's exactly what the Non-Cloning Theorem is all about.

## So what do we do?

With this knowledge at hand, we need to rething how we solve problems in quantum computing, since we are not able to utilize one of the core features of our classical siblings, `the copying mechanism`!
 We have to find totally new ways to run our calculations.

But guess what, its not a bug, it's a feature! This feature makes it virtually impossible to spy on quantum messages. If a spy tries to "look" at a secret quantum message to copy it, the theorem states that they will automatically wreck the original message. This will also in automatically tell the sender and receiver that someone was spying on them!

In quantum physics, you can't simply make a perfect copy of something if you don't know exactly what it is. 
That's one of the strange and special rules by which the quantum world works!
