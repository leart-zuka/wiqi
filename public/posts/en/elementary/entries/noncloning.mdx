## Introduction

Cloning? That sounds like science fiction, doesn’t it?
In the quantum world, "cloning" is just a fancy word for "copying."
And the **Non-Cloning Theorem** or **No-Cloning Theorem** is a very important and kind of a strange rule. It says that you can never make a perfect copy of a quantum state.

Imagine a life without a printer or without copying files on your smartphone. That would be really inconvenient, right? 
Now what does that mean in the quantum world? Imagine a spinning coin ([_Quantum Superposition_](/en/posts/entries/elementary/superposition)). You want to make a perfect copy of that spinning coin, but to do that, you would have to know exactly how it is spinning at that moment. 
But if you touch to look at it, you will disturb it and it will stop spinning! So you can never know exactly how it was spinning, and therefore you can never make a perfect copy of it.
That's exactly what the Non-Cloning Theorem is all about.

## So what do we do?

Now we have to rethink how we solve problems in quantum computing, since in classical computing we're used to just copying data all the time.
But in the quantum world, we can't. We have to find totally new ways to run our calculations.
But guess what, its not a bug, it's a feature! This feature makes it impossible to spy on quantum messages. If a spy tries to "look" at a secret message to copy it, the theorem says they will automatically wreck the original message. The sender and receiver will know immediately that someone was listening.

In quantum physics, you can't simply make a perfect copy of something if you don't know exactly what it is. 
That's one of the strange and special rules by which the quantum world works!
