# Introduction

Cloning? This sounds like science fiction, right? Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
In this context cloning is just a fancy word for copying.
The non-cloning theorem states that there is no operation that can copy a quantum state.
Think of it like life without a printer or without copying files on your smartphone. It is quite unfortunate because
now we need to rethink on how to solve problems in quantum computing, because in classical computing we are used to copy data.
There is a small mathematical proof to show why this works however this is beyond the elementary level.

In quantum physics, you simply can’t make a perfect copy of something if you don’t already know exactly what it is.
It’s one of the strange and special rules of how the quantum world works!
