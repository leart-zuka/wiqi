## Entanglement

Two particles are entangled when their properties are connected in a way that we can't describe them separately. If you know something about one particle, you automatically know the same thing about the other, even if they're far apart.
To understand this, think of two coins. A coin can show either heads or tails, just like a particle can have properties like spin up or spin down. Now imagine two coins are entangled. One person flips coin A, and another person flips coin B in a different room. If person 1 looks at their coin and it shows heads, they instantly know the other coin will show tails, even before person 2 checks their coin. The results are always linked.

## The EPR Thought Experiment

In 1935, three scientists—Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen—came up with an idea to show that quantum mechanics (the rules that govern particles) might not be complete. This idea is called the EPR thought experiment.
In this thought experiment, two particles are created together and become entangled. Then, the particles are separated by a large distance. When one particle is measured, its spin (up or down) is known, and this measurement instantly tells you the spin of the other particle—even though it’s far away.

Einstein found this strange and called it "spooky action at a distance." He believed that there must be some hidden information, like a secret code, stored in the particles from the beginning. This hidden information, he thought, could explain the connection without breaking the rule that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.
However, later experiments showed that there’s no hidden code. The particles really are connected through something called entanglement, and this doesn’t send information faster than light. It’s just a weird property of quantum mechanics.

## Bell’s Inequality

In 1964, a scientist named John Bell created a test to figure out if the connection between particles could be explained by Einstein’s idea of hidden information. This test is called Bell’s inequality.
Bell showed that if particles had hidden information, their behavior in experiments would follow a specific rule. But when scientists ran the experiments, they found that the rule was broken. This meant the particles weren’t using hidden information—quantum mechanics was right all along!
