## What is Interference?

Imagine throwing a paper plane from one hill of a mountain to another.

This is what **interference** is like: sometimes waves, add together to make something **stronger**, and sometimes they **cancel each other** out.

You can for example see interference with water waves.

- When two waves meet at the same time, their ripples can join together to make a **bigger wave** (constructive interference).
- Or they can crash into each other so that the water goes almost **flat** (destructive interference), so we can't see any movement anymore.

So waves have "hills" and "valleys". If hills of two waves meet, they produce an even stroger wave.
But if the "valley" of one wave meets the "hill" of another wave, the wave dissapears. This happens with all kinds of waves — water, sound, light, even radio signals!

## Interference in Quantum Worlds

In our world, light can act a bit like water waves. But long ago, scientists were unsure and argued, whether light made of little balls, or if it is a wave?
To test this, they shined light through a slit. If light were just little balls, you would only see two bright spots on the wall behind the doors.
But something surprising happened! The light made a pattern of bright and dark stripes — just like ripples on water when waves overlap. That’s called interference, and it showed that light behaves like a wave.

## Why it is important

Interference is not just fun to watch in water — it’s also what makes many modern things work, like headphones that cancel noise, and even **quantum computers**. Quantum computers use interference like a clever trick: they cancel out wrong answers and boost the right ones.
