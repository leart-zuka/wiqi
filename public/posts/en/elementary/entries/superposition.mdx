## Corpuscular Theory of Light

Sir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory was one of the first scientific ideas about how light works.
This theory says that light is made of tiny particles called corpuscles (which means “little particles”). These particles are thought to come from light sources, like the Sun, and move in straight lines at a certain speed. The way they interact with things like surfaces, walls, and our eyes follows simple physical rules.

Newton came up with this idea through his work on optics. He didn’t believe the idea that light behaves like waves. He argued, that one can hear sound from behind an obstacle, but can’t see light, thus supporting his view that light is a particle. However, his theory had problems.
For example, Newton thought different colors of light came from particles of different sizes, but experiments couldn’t prove this. Also, some effects, like interference (when light waves mix to create bright and dark patterns), didn’t fit his idea. These gaps showed the limits of the corpuscular theory.

## Huygens’ Wave Model of Light

At the same time, another scientist, Christiaan Huygens, had a different idea. He said light behaves like a wave, much like ripples on water.
Huygens suggested that light travels as waves that spread out in all directions. He explained that each point in a wave creates smaller waves called wavelets, and these wavelets combine to form the overall wavefront. This helped explain things like:

- Reflection (light bouncing off surfaces),
- Refraction (light bending when it enters something like water), and
- Diffraction (light bending around objects).

Huygens’ wave model explained many things about light, but it wasn’t perfect. It couldn’t explain some discoveries made later, like the photoelectric effect, which showed how light can knock electrons off metal surfaces. These discoveries eventually led scientists to new ideas about light.

## The Double-Slit Experiment

In 1801, a scientist named Thomas Young did an experiment that showed light behaves like waves. He shone light through two tiny slits onto a screen.
Newton’s particle theory and Huygens’ wave theory predicted different outcomes:

If light were made of particles, you’d see two bright spots on the screen where the particles passed through the slits.
But if light behaved like waves, the waves would mix, creating a pattern of bright and dark bands on the screen.

Young observed the bright and dark bands, which could only be explained if light acted like waves. This experiment was a big challenge to Newton’s particle theory and provided strong evidence for Huygens’ wave model.

## Wave-Particle Duality

Young’s experiment supported the wave theory of light, but later discoveries showed that it wasn’t the whole story. In the 19th and 20th centuries, scientists found that light also behaves like particles in some situations.
One key discovery was the photoelectric effect. In 1902, Philipp Lenard studied how light can make electrons jump out of metals. He found that this effect depended on the light’s color (or frequency), not just its brightness, which didn’t match Huygens’ wave model.

In 1905, Albert Einstein explained this by proposing that light is made of tiny packets of energy called photons. This brought back the idea of light as particles. But since photons can also behave like waves, it introduced a new concept: wave-particle duality.
In 1924, Louis de Broglie expanded this idea by suggesting that not just light, but also particles like electrons, could behave like waves. This became a key idea in quantum mechanics.

## Schrödinger’s Cat

The strange behavior of particles acting like both waves and particles led to even weirder ideas in quantum mechanics. One of these is called superposition, which means a particle can be in multiple states at the same time until it’s observed.
To explain this, a physicist named Erwin Schrödinger imagined a thought experiment with a cat:

A cat is put in a box with a poison that depends on a random event, like the decay of a radioactive atom.

Until someone opens the box, the cat is in a superposition—both alive and dead at the same time.

Opening the box forces the system to choose one outcome: the cat is either alive or dead.
This thought experiment shows how quantum systems can exist in multiple states until we measure them.
