## Schrödinger’s Cat and Measurement

In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger created a thought experiment to explain the following idea in quantum physics. Imagine a cat in a box with a poison that might or might not be released. If the poison is released, the cat dies, and if not, the cat stays alive. But until we open the box, we don't know if the cat is alive or dead. According to quantum physics, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time until we look.

This is similar to how quantum bits (qubits) work in computers. A qubit can be in two states at once, like 0 and 1, but when we measure it, it "chooses" one of those states.

## Heisenbergs’ Uncertainty Principle

Werner Heisenberg said that in quantum physics, we can't measure everything perfectly. For example, we can’t know both the exact position and speed of an electron at the same time. If we measure one, we lose information about the other.

Imagine a ball on the end of a rope. If you take a photo, you can see where the ball is, but not how fast it's moving. If you record a video, you can see its speed, but not its exact position.

This idea is called the Uncertainty Principle. It means that we can’t know everything about tiny particles, like electrons, at once. We can only know a range of possibilities.
