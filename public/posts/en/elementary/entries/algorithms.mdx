Computational Complexity Theory helps us understand how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. It’s about how much time or memory a computer needs to finish a job. Sometimes it takes longer when there are more things to do.

Imagine you need to look for a cat in many boxes. A computer that opens each box one by one would take $$ O(n) $$ steps, where $$ n $$ is the number of boxes. Big O notation helps us understand how time increases when there are more boxes to check.

## Grover’s Algorithm

If you have to search through millions of boxes, a computer might take $$ O(n) $$ steps. But with a better algorithm, like Grover’s Algorithm, the computer can search much faster, taking only $$ O({\sqrt{n}}) $$ steps. Grover’s Algorithm shows how quantum computers can be much faster at solving large problems.
