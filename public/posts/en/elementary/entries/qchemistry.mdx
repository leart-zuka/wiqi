## Quantum Simulation - Chemistry

Making a new drugs can take more than 10 years and costs a lot of money. That is, because it is a very challenging task. Finding a new drug is like finding the key to a very, very complex lock.

But now, scientists use computers to help design and test both drugs and materials. This is called CADD — a bit like testing if a key fits in your lock in a video game before trying it in real life.

But here’s the problem: drugs and materials, every object consists of tiny parts called molecules. Our molecules interacting with an environment in the human body for example, is like the key interacting with the lock. The more complex our problem (our lock), the harder it is to find a molecule (key) for it.

And these molecules don’t act like normal things. They follow weird rules from quantum physics, where things can be in two places at once or be linked even when they’re far apart.

Normal computers can’t understand this very well. That’s why scientists are building quantum computers. These special computers use qubits, which are like super bits, because they follow the same rules from quantum physics. Qubits can copy how molecules really behave!

To use quantum computers for science, we need to describe the energy of a molecule with something called a Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is a mathematical concept that tells us the total energy of a quantum system and governs how its state changes over time. But quantum computers don’t understand molecules the way humans do — we have to translate their behavior using different transformation. Through these transformations, we can make a qubit behave exactly like one of the electrons in our molecule. It's a bit like teaching the computer a new language.

Once we’ve done that, the quantum computer can help us figure out what our drug might do, or how to build new materials — all without waiting years to test it in the real world.
