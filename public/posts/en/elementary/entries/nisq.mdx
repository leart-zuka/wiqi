## NISQ era

We all know that making something brand new, extremely well, takes time and practice. There are lots of things to be learnt along the way.
Quantum technology is no different. Before we have very big and powerful quantum computers, we will first have many smaller and less powerful ones. These are currently already in existence, and can be accessed via the cloud by anyone!

Unfortunately, they won't always give the answer you expect, because they still make mistakes. We call the reason for these mistakes "noise". Noise can come from all different sources - even a train passing nearby can affect your answer!
We say these are "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)".

The mobiles and computers we use today are not perfect. They make a lot of mistakes too. But we have found a way to make it correct its own mistakes. Similarly, the end goal of NISQ is also to build a self-correcting quantum computer, a quantum computer that can automatically find and fix its own errors.
If we are able to reach it, then we wont be in the NISQ era anymore.

## What can we do with noisy computers?

So what can we do with these noisy machines? Luckily, they are perfect for problems where getting a perfect, exact answer isn't necessary. Like scheduling school timetables for example. Or finding the best route for a pizza delivery van to take. These could be solved using a NISQ computer. But just not yet. Scientists are still working on it.

The question still remains, whether these devices can perform a task better than any classical computer, a milestone called "quantum advantage". This is a surprisingly high bar to clear.
Lots of work is currently underway to discover how to still do useful calculations with NISQ computers.
