## NISQ

We all know that making something brand new, extremely well, takes time and practice. There are lots of things to be learnt along the way.
Quantum technology is no different. Before we have very big and powerful quantum computers, we will first have many smaller and less powerful ones. These are currently already in existence, and can be accessed via the cloud by anyone!

Unfortunately, they won't always give the answer you expect, because they still make mistakes. We call the reason for these mistakes "noise". Noise can come from all different sources - even a train passing nearby can affect your answer!
We say these are "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)".
