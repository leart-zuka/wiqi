## [Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe)

Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a modern version of the classic game, designed to teach the basics of quantum mechanics through gameplay. Key concepts like superposition, entanglement, and collapse come into play as you mark squares and watch the game evolve.

### How It Works:

- **Superposition**: Mark two squares at once, reflecting the quantum idea of being in two states at the same time (until taking a measurement).
- **Entanglement**: Marks can become linked, affecting gameplay.
- **Collapse**: When certain conditions are met, the quantum state collapses into a classical state.

### Gameplay Overview:

- Take turns marking squares and watch how your marks interact with one another.
- The first player to create a classical tic-tac-toe wins, but if both players achieve it simultaneously, special scoring rules apply.

This game is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.smanis.konstantinos.qttt&hl=en-US&pli=1) and is a fun way to experience quantum mechanics in a familiar format.
