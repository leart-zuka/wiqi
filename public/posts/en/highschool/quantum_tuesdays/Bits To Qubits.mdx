# Intro

Today we want to understand the differences between a bit, that's being used in our day to day electronics and everything where data is being handled, and a qubit, which forms the basis of a quantum computer.  

But first we have to look at a standard bit is before we move forward to its quantum sibling.

Afterwards we're going to take a look at how we can transform these two newly learned concepts and how qubits behave much more differently thanks to their quantum properties.

# Bit

A bit is the most basic unit of information when it comes data that is being handled, e.g. by computers.
It stores one value that can be represented as either a "1" or "0" (or "on" or "off"), similar to how a light switch can either be in an "on" or "off" position.

## Qubit

A qubit is unfortunately not as simple as a regular bit and involves a bit of math to properly define it.

In essence a qubit can be understood as the superposition of two basis states. So it's as if we were to overlap the two outcomes of our bit (so "1" and "0").

Mathematically one would write this superposition state as:

$$ \ket{\Psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} $$

however after measuring our qubit (i.e. by looking at our fancy measurement devices), the qubit will ultimately end up being a "1" or "0" or commonly represented as `|1>` or `|0>`, where the probabilities of landing in either state are expressed via the two prefactors whose squares must be equal to 1:

$$ |\alpha|^2  + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

But the interesting features lie in the fact that the qubit randomly decides which value, so either "1" or "0" or commonly represented as `|1>` or `|0>` when talking about qubits, it wants to hold when performing the actual measurement.

One way of visualizing how this "random picking" might work is with a so called `Bloch Sphere`, where the chances of picking `|1>` or `|0>` are represented by an arrow pointing from the center of the surface to the sphere.

### Visualization of a qubit state

A so called qubit state, so basically the chances of the qubit either being a `|1>` or `|0>`, can be described by a so called `Bloch Sphere`, named after the physicist Felix Bloch.

The main ideas are:

- The further the arrow points up or down, the higher the chance that when measuring the state of the qubit, it will either show `|0>` or `|1>`. This also means that if the arrow points along the equator, the chances of getting either `|0>` or `|1>` are 50/50.

- After the measurement, depending on the outcome, the qubit will always point either fully up or fully down, as that's when it `collapses` to its definite value.

- Its rotation, so whether it points along the x- or y-axis also plays a role, but is beyond the scope of this post.

This all seems very interesting, but now we also need to understand how to manipulate these qu-/bits in order to make them useful for our, hopefully good-natured, purposes.

# Logical Gates

Logical gates are components of electrical or quantum circuits that allow us to tansform and manipulate the data that is being stored in bits and qubits.

## Bits

Bits as stated before either have a value of "1" or "0", and logical gates allow us to to change these values itself or use them to change values of other bits.

Two important gates, among the many others, are the so called `NOT` and `AND` gate.

### NOT - Gate

A `NOT` gate behaves ins a rather simple fassion, by taking our input and negating it, thus turning a "1" into a "0" and vice verca.

### AND - Gate

For an `AND` gate we require two bits of input which then gives us one one bit of output. Only if both bits are "1", then the output is also "1", in any other case the output is "0".

## Qubits

A quantum gate in essence always describes a rotation of our state, so our arrow on the Bloch Sphere.
The main forms of these rotations are the X,Y, and Z - Gates, which as the names suggest, all perform a rotation along their respective axes.
Another very important 1 qubit gate, is the so called `Hadamard Gate`, named after physicist `Jacques Hadamard`, which has the ability to bring any of our base states, in this case `|0>` and `|1>`, to a superposition state, so to our equator.

### 1 Qubit Gates

### X - Gate

The `X` gate describes a rotation around the x-axis and can be represented via the Pauli X matrix:

$$\sigma_x =\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix} $$

### Y - Gate

The `Y` gate describes a rotation around the y-axis and can be represented via the Pauli Y matrix:

$$\sigma_y =\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0\end{pmatrix} $$

### Z - Gate

The `Z` gate describes a rotation around the z-axis and can be represented via the Pauli Y matrix:

$$\sigma_z =\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{pmatrix} $$

### Hadamard - Gate

$$ H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix} $$

### 2 Qubit gates

With this newly gained knowledge, let's now move on to 2 qubit gates, which contrary to the classical logic gates, don't give us only one output based on two inputs, but rather change the state of our two input qubits.

### C-NOT Gate

The most notable 2 qubit gate is the so called `C-NOT` or `controlled NOT` gate. This gate allows us to perform a rotation of one qubit (typically one around the x-axis) based on the state of the other qubit. The one qubit we use to check if we're going to perform the rotation is called the `controlling qubit` (indicated in the images by being on the side with the dot) and the other qubit is called the `target qubit` (indicated in the images by being on the side with the cross).

Only if the `controlling qubit` is in a state `|1>` then it will perform a rotation on the `target qubit`.

Now what can we do with all of this?

As mentioned before, if our qubit state is pointing along the equator, that means that the chance of getting either a `|0>` or a `|1>` are 50/50. This begs the question, but what if we have a qubit in such a state, and then perform a `C-NOT` operation with it as the `controlling qubit` on a different `target qubit`.

Doing so would create something physicists call `Quantum Entanglement`, as after performing such operations, we would create a state where the measurement of one qubit will directly influence the outcome of the next one, technically allowing for instant communication between two people if both were to share one of the two qubits. 

The states that can result from these circuits, are called the so called `Bell's states` (named after `John Stewart Bell`) or `EPR pairs` (named after `Albert Einstein`, `Boris Podolsky`, and `Nathan Rosen`):

$$ \ket{\Phi^+} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}} $$
$$ \ket{\Phi^-} = \frac{\ket{00} - \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}} $$
$$ \ket{\Psi^+} = \frac{\ket{10} + \ket{01}}{\sqrt{2}} $$
$$ \ket{\Psi^-} = \frac{\ket{10} - \ket{01}}{\sqrt{2}} $$

Furthermore what is the best way to technically realize such qubits? Well there is no right answer as of now, as there are many ways to create such a qubit system. Be it trapping ions in so called `Iontraps` and shooting at them with lasers to perform such roations (also works with neutral atoms trapped between fiberoptic cavities), running a current through `superconducting circuits` where the direction of the special particles indicate our state, or influencing `individual nuclear spins` inside of a `diamond crystal`. No perfect solution has been proposed so far, as all different platforms which we mentioned have their ups and downs.

However this is a topic of discussion for another day.
