## Entanglement

Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two particles become deeply connected, so their properties depend on each other no matter how far apart they are. Instead of being independent, the quantum state of one particle is directly tied to the quantum state of the other. This means you cannot fully describe one particle without also describing the other.
To understand this, imagine two coins. A coin has two possible outcomes when flipped: heads (H) or tails (T). Similarly, particles can have states like spin up (\uparrow) or spin down (\downarrow). Normally, flipping two coins gives four possible combinations: \text{HH, HT, TH, TT}.

But if the two coins are entangled, flipping one coin determines the result of the other. For example, if coin A shows heads, you instantly know coin B will show tails, even before looking at it. This correlation exists even if the coins (or particles) are far apart.

In quantum mechanics, this relationship can be expressed mathematically using a quantum state called a Bell state, which represents a maximally entangled system. One such Bell state is:

\ket{\Psi^-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}\big),

where \ket{\uparrow\downarrow} means particle A is spin up, and particle B is spin down, and \ket{\downarrow\uparrow} means the opposite.

## The EPR Thought Experiment

In 1935, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR) used entanglement in a thought experiment to argue that quantum mechanics might be incomplete. They wanted to show that quantum mechanics didn’t account for everything happening at the particle level.
Imagine two particles are created together and become entangled. They are then moved far apart. Each particle has a property called spin, which can be either spin up or spin down. According to quantum mechanics, before you measure the spin of either particle, they exist in a superposition, described as:

\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} + \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}\big)

When you measure one particle’s spin (e.g., particle A), the wavefunction "collapses," and the result of the second particle (e.g., particle B) becomes known instantly. For example, if you find particle A is spin up, particle B must be spin down, and vice versa.
Einstein found this idea troubling. If particle A and particle B are far apart, how can measuring one instantly affect the other? He called this “spooky action at a distance” and suggested that the particles might carry hidden information (or hidden variables) that determined their spins from the beginning.

## Bell’s Inequality

In 1964, physicist John Bell proposed a test to determine whether quantum mechanics or hidden variable theories were correct. Bell derived a mathematical inequality, now called Bell’s inequality, which sets limits on the outcomes of measurements if hidden variables exist.
For example, Bell’s inequality for two entangled particles can be written as:
|E(a, b) - E(a, c)| \leq 1 + E(b, c),
where E(a,b)E(a, b) is the correlation between measurements made on particles using settings aa and bb. If experimental results violate Bell’s inequality, it means hidden variables cannot explain the entanglement.
Experiments testing Bell’s inequality consistently show violations, proving that quantum mechanics—and not hidden variables—describes the behavior of entangled particles. These results demonstrate that the connection between entangled particles is a fundamental aspect of quantum nature, not a hidden "message."
