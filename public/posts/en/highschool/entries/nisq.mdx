## Quantum Tech, One Step at a Time

Developing a new technology takes time. In the case of quantum technology, understanding how to best create it is very closely linked to understanding quantum science better too. This lends itself well to building up our knowledge iteratively, as quantum technology will be extremely good at shedding light on quantum science!
For example, some quantum computers use superconducting qubits as their hardware basis. In order to keep them superconducting, they need to be cooled within a big fridge called a cryostat. At the moment, this is limiting the size of the quantum computer to how much we can fit inside the cryostat. The more wires we add, the more it heats up.
But what if we ask quantum computers themselves for an answer? (Using AI to create AI kinda situation) It might as well work. They might help us discover a material that works at room temperature. If we found that, we wouldn't need the giant fridge at all!

## NISQ era

The mobiles and computers we use today are not perfect. They make a lot of mistakes too. But we have found a way to make it correct its own mistakes. Similarly, the end goal in Quantum Tech is to build a self-correcting quantum computer, a quantum computer that can automatically find and fix its own errors. 

But we are far far away from that. So before we are able to reach it, we will need to practice and get better at building lots of smaller quantum computers. These small computers are poweful, but still imperfect; they are influenced by outside "noise" that affects or destroys the quantum states inside. This noise can mess up the delicate quantum qubits inside. Because noise builds up over time, we can only run calculations for a very short period before the errors take over.

This era of quantum computers is what we are currently in. Its called the "NISQ era", which stands for "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum". “Intermediate Scale” means that they have too many qubits but not enough qubits to become self-correcting. Without this self-correction, the noise will always be a problem. 
Therefore, we are very far from realising the full potential of quantum computing. Currently we have hundreds of qubits per quantum computer at best. To fulfill many potential applications, more like millions are needed.
This is very comparable to classical computers: the computer that helped put man on the moon for the first time had only thousands of transistors whereas laptops now have tens of billions!

## What can we do with NISQ?

So what can we do with these noisy machines? Luckily, they are perfect for problems where getting a perfect, exact answer isn't necessary. These are often problems in optimization, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. Like scheduling school timetables for example.

The question still remains, whether these devices can perform a task that surpasses the capabilities of any classical computer, a milestone called "quantum advantage". This is a surprisingly high bar to clear. 
Lots of work is currently underway to discover how to still do useful calculations with NISQ computers. It is a case of hardware and software meeting in the middle. As the hardware scales up, clever tricks in software help get the most of each experiment.
