## NISQ

Developing a new technology takes time. In the case of quantum technology, understanding how to best create it is very closely linked to understanding quantum science better too. This lends itself well to building up our knowledge iteratively, as quantum technology will be extremely good at shedding light on quantum science!

The end goal is to build a so-called “fault-tolerant quantum computer”. All computers make errors while processing, but whether these errors can be adequately corrected is the hallmark of an accurate, dependable computer.

Before we are able to reach this, we will need to practice building lots of smaller quantum computers. These will still be imperfect. They will be influenced by "noise" that affects or destroys the quantum states inside. This noise will accumulate meaning only shorter calculations will be possible.
This era of quantum computers is what we are currently in. It is referred to as the "NISQ era", which stands for "Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum".

The only accesible algorithms will have a smaller number of qubits and a shorter length of runtime than what scientists predict will realise the full potential of quantum computing.
Lots of work is currently underway to discover how to still do useful calculations with NISQ computers.
