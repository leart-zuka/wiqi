## Introduction

In quantum physics, there is a rule called the **Non-Cloning Theoren** or **No-Cloning Theorem**, which states that no operation can be performed that perfectly copies a quantum state. 
To understand this, imagine you have two quantum objects: one with the information you want to copy (like a spinning coin), and one that's blank, ready to become a copy.
The **Non-Cloning theorem** states that it is impossible perform an operation that can take the information from the first object and transfer an exact copy of it to the second object, every single time.

## How do we know this?

To understand why this is impossible, let's think about our spinning coin. It's not heads and it's not tails, but a [_superposition_](/en/posts/entries/highschool/superposition) of both.
The "information" we want to copy is the exact way how it's spinning. Now, to be a perfect copier, a machine would have to be able to reliably copy this piece of information every time. Not just once or twice, but every time. 

**But here's the catch**: To copy the spin, the machine would have to "look" at how the coin is spinning, which is otherwise known as performing a [measurement](/en/posts/entries/highschool/measurement). However when "looking" at the coin, we would force our coin to stop spinning to check which side is facing up. It has destroyed the very "spin" it was trying to copy!

This is the physical reason why it's impossible to copy quantum information.

## Can we prove this mathematically?

The more formal proof just shows this with math. It pretends a "copy machine" does exist and then finds a contradiction. This is a common method in mathematics and science: you assume something works and then see if everything fits. Just like when you are unsure about a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
You just place it and see if everything fits together. If it doesn't, you know that piece can't be right. 

Now assuming such a machine exists, we want to test it with two different sets of information: one for the first object and another for the second.
The procedure should still work and copy the information correctly in each case.

This is where it gets tricky: In quantum mechanics, the way two pieces of information are related to each other is very important. This relationship (the so-called "inner product") must remain the same before and after the copying process. The inner product is a measure of how similar two states are when we compare then. When we perform the calculations (you can check out the more in depth explanation [here](/en/posts/entries/college/noncloning)), we find that this rule poses a major problem. It turns out that the copying process can only work if the two pieces of information are either:

1. Completely unrelated (as different as possible), or
2. Exactly the same (already identical).

In quantum mechanics, however, we often deal with information that doesn't fall into these categories. It can be a mixture or [_superposition_](/en/posts/entries/highschool/superposition) of different possibilities. This means that the copying process cannot handle every situation—it only works in very specific cases. It's like having a copier that can only copy blank pages or pages that are exactly the same as the original. 
The idea of copying arbitrary quantum information thus proves impossible for any quantum state. For this reason, the law of non-cloning applies: 
> It is impossible to create a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state.

## So what does this mean?

This rule forces us to rethink how we build computers from the ground up, because we can't just copy-paste data like we do on our laptops. 
But guess what, its not a bug, it's a feature! This feature makes it impossible to spy on quantum messages. If a spy tries to "look" at a secret message to copy it, the theorem says they will automatically wreck the original message. The sender and receiver will know immediately that someone was listening.

In quantum physics, you can't simply make a perfect copy of something if you don't know exactly what it is. 
That's one of the strange and special rules by which the quantum world works!
