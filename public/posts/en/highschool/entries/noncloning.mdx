# Introduction

In quantum physics, there’s a rule called the non-cloning theorem,
which says you can’t create an operation that perfectly copies a quantum state.
To understand this, imagine you have two quantum objects:
one contains the information you want to copy, and the other is empty,
ready to become a copy. The non-cloning theorem says
it’s impossible to build a process (a "unitary operator")
that can take the information from the first object and make an exact copy of it
in the second object.

# Proof

To understand why copying a quantum state is impossible, we start by pretending it is possible.
This is a common method in math and science: assume something works, and then see if that leads to a contradiction.
Now, let’s test this process with two different pieces of information:
one for the first object and a different one for the second.
The process should still work and copy the information correctly in each case.

Here’s where things get tricky: in quantum mechanics,
the way two pieces of information are related to each other is very important.
This relationship (called the "inner product") has to stay the same before and after the copying process.
If we do the math (which we won’t go into here), we find that this rule creates a big problem.
It turns out that the copying process can only work if the two pieces of information are either:

1. Completely unrelated (as different as possible), or
2. Exactly the same (already identical).

But in quantum mechanics, we often deal with information that doesn’t fall into these categories.
It can be a mix or "superposition" of different possibilities.
This means the copying process can’t handle every situation—it only works in very specific cases.

So, the idea of copying any quantum information turns out to be impossible for an arbitrary quantum state.
This is why the non-cloning theorem is true: you can’t create a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state.
