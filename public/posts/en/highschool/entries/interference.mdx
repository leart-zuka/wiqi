## Wave Motion and Interference

When two coherent waves meet, their waves add up to form a new one. This process is referred to as **“interference”**. The resulting wave's amplitude depends on the phase difference between the two waves. If the waves are in phase, meaning their phases are each others even multiplicatives by $$ \pi $$ (180 degrees), their peaks and troughs align. They reinforce each other, resulting in **constructive** interference, where the amplitude of the combined wave is greater than either individual wave. On the other hand, if the waves are out of phase — meaning their multiplicatives are odd, their peaks align with the troughs of the other wave — they cancel each other out. This leads to **destructive** interference, where the combined wave’s amplitude is reduced.

Interference can occur with any type of wave: light, water, radio, gravity or acoustic waves. It is a fundamental concept in physics and plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, where it is referred to as **“quantum interference”**.

## Classical Interference

Interference of waves was experimentally demonstrated by Young through his **double-slit experiment**. This experiment largely contributed to the acceptance of the wave model of light. Young’s qualitative observations showed that light cannot be particle in nature as this would otherwise produce only two bright bands directly behind the two slits. Rather, it is a wave, where the waves that pass a slit interfere with each other and create alternating **maxima** (constructive interference) and **minima** (destructive interference). These are then visible as bright (here red) and dark (here black) bands on a visual screen:

## Interference in Quantum Mechanics:

Quantum interference describes the interference of quanta on each other, while in a superposition state. When a quantum system, like a qubit, is in a superposition of states, it behaves similarly to a wave, with each state corresponding to a different probability amplitude. The different probability amplitudes can interfere with each other, causing the same interference phenomena (constructive and deconstructive), leading to an increased or decreased probability of measuring one of the states.
The probability distribution for detecting a quantum particle when two paths are available (as in the double-slit experiment) can be expressed as the sum of three contributions: the probability from path A alone, the probability from path B alone, and an interference term that arises from the superposition of the two paths:

$$ |\Psi_A(x,t)|^2 $$: Probability of detecting the particle at position $$x$$ if it came only from source A.

$$ |\Psi_B(x,t)|^2 $$: Probability of detecting the particle at position $$x$$ if it came only from source B.

and the interference term $$ \Psi*A(x,t)\Psi_B^*(x,t) + \Psi*A^*(x,t)\Psi_B(x,t) $$. This interference contribution results from the wave-like nature of quantum states.
Using complex conjugates, this term can also be rewritten as:

$$
2 \operatorname{Re} (\Psi_A^*(x,t) \Psi_B(x,t))
$$

This thereby implies, that if interference is present, the total probability distribution $$ P(x) $$ will show constructive and destructive interference patterns. However, if interference is absent (for example, if the paths are distinguishable), then the interference term disappears, and the total probability is simply the sum of individual probabilities:

$$
P(x) = |\Psi_A(x,t)|^2 + |\Psi_B(x,t)|^2
$$

This equation is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, demonstrating how probability amplitudes interfere rather than probabilities themselves.

## Applications in Quantum Computing

This phenomena is a very powerful tool in quantum computing, since quantum computers operate on probabilities, rather than definitive states. Interference can be used to manipulate the probabilities of quanta by applying certain quantum gates and operators in a quantum computer, effectively controlling and changing the outcome of computations. Different quantum algorithms can be used to create a sequence of operations on a quantum computer which then yield the desired manipulation through interference, and thereby the desired output.

If you think of qubits as coins that can land in either “heads” or “tails” state, interference would act as a force, such as a magnet, directing the coin into a different position. It would therefore alter the probability of the coin landing in one state or the other. Through quantum gates, one can manipulate this “magnetic force” to control the probabilities.
