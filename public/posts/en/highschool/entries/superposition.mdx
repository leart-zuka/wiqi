## Corpuscular Theory of Light:

Sir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory was one of the earliest scientific attempts at understanding the nature of light. In optics, the corpuscular theory of light states that light is made up of small discrete particles called "corpuscles" (little particles). These particles were believed to be emitted from luminous sources and travel in straight lines at a finite speed. Their interactions with materials such as surfaces, walls, and the human eye were assumed to follow Newtonian physics. Isaac Newton laid the foundations for this theory through his work in optics. Newton rejected the wave theory of light, primarily because he believed, that unlike sound, light lacked diffraction characteristics. He argued, that one can hear sound from behind an obstacle, but can’t see light, thus supporting his view that light is a particle.
However, his model had key limitations. For example, Newton proposed that different colors of light resulted from corpuscles of various sizes, but this claim could not be experimentally validated. Moreover, phenomena like interference—where light waves can constructively and destructively interfere with each other—could not be explained by his particle theory. This lack of an explanation for wave-like phenomena such as interference pointed to the limitations of the corpuscular model.

## Huygens’ Wave Model of Light:

In contrast to Newton's corpuscular theory, Christiaan Huygens' wave model of light proposed that light behaves as a wave, specifically a longitudinal wave. In the 17th century, Huygens suggested that light's propagation could be better understood by observing the motion of water waves. In addition, he extended the understanding of light as a wave by proposing that a primary wave front can be perceived as infinite number of points, each point generating a secondary wavelet in a spherical manner. The interference of these secondary wavelets create wavefronts of varying shapes and direction. His model is thereby also often used to understand the concept of diffraction. At the time of this proposal, Huygens was able to explain most of the properties of light including refraction, reflection & partial refraction and reflection, as well as diffraction.
However, similarly to Newton’s model, this model also showed limitations. While it was successful in explaining many of light's classical properties, it could not account for the quantum mechanical phenomena observed later, such as the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, or the Raman effect. These limitations ultimately led to further developments in the understanding of light.

## The Double-slit Experiment

In 1801, Thomas Young conducted an experiment using a double-slit apparatus, providing clear evidence of light's wave-like nature. A monochromatic light source was directed through two narrow slits, creating an interference pattern on a screen placed behind them. A viewing screen was set-up directly behind the apparatus. Newton's corpuscular (particle) model of light and Huygens' wave model of light made different predictions regarding the pattern of light formed on the screen. According to Newton, if light was a particle or consisted of particles, only light particles which passed through the slits would be observed on the viewing screen, one would thereby only see two bands.  
Instead, Young observed multiple bright and dark bands spanning a large area. This phenomenon could only be explained by the wave nature of light. The waves passing through the slits interfere with each other, creating alternating dark and bright spots (minima and maxima), since constructive interference produce maxima and destructive produce minima.

The double-slit diffraction experiment challenged Newton’s theory of light and provided strong evidence supporting Huygens’ wave model, as this experiment was conducted before the development of quantum mechanics and the concept of wave–particle duality.

## Wave-Particle Duality

Although Young’s experiment validated the wave model of light, it’s limitations were still not solved and led to researchers in the 19th and 20th century challenging this model, the discovery of the photoelectric effect (light can eject electrons from the atoms of several metals) being a major breakdown of this model. In 1902, Philipp Lenard, studied how the energy of the emitted photoelectrons varied with the intensity and frequency of light. He also measured the magnitude of current produced by the ejected electrons.

The variable light source was used to illuminate a positively charged metal plate (cathode) in an evacuated tube (vacuum). The ejected electrons, which are termed photoelectrons, were traveling towards the negatively charged metal (anode). But the experimental results did not align with the predictions made based on Huygen’s model. In 1905, Albert Einstein formulated the “quantum model of light” from this concept and the experimental observations: light consists of photons which are discrete packets of energy, leading back to particle behavior. It was Louis de Broglie, who then introduced the idea of electron waves in 1924, merging the idea of them as a particle, as well as as a wave, also connecting to a similar relativistic formulation of Einstein a few years prior. De Broglie's proposal of “wave–particle duality” of electrons led to Schrödinger’s wave equation of motion for electrons, now known as “Schrödinger’s equation”:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ket{\Psi(t)} = \hat{H} \ket{\Psi(t)}
$$

## Schrödinger’s Cat

In quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality leads to a concept referred to as “superposition”.

$$
\ket{\Psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
$$

A particle, such as an electron, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behavior. Due its wave nature, it can exist in multiple wave paths simultaneously, in a superposition of states. By measuring the particle, this superposition collapses into one of these states, a phenomena known as “wave function collapse”.

In 1935 physicist Erwin Schrödinger formulated the following thought experiment as an analogy. A hypothetical cat is locked into a box with a deadly poison, which may or may not be released at a random point depending on the decay of a radioactive atom in the box. If the atom decays, the poison flask breaks and the cat dies. If the atom does not decay, the cat stays alive. According to quantum mechanics, until one opens the box, the cat is to be considered simultaneously both alive and dead. The system's state is a quantum superposition of these two possibilities.
The image below illustrates this superposition, where the cat’s state is represented as a quantum state vector. It combines the two equally probable $$ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) $$ possibilities of the cat being alive or dead. Opening the box will collapse the system into only one of the two states.
